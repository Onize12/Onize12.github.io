This is the week we had to do our presentations and it was done on Wednesday. My presentation was alright although i had a little bit of anxiety but i scaled through regardless, I found other participants project interesting too. It was hectic preparing for this presentation but i am glad my team and I got it done.Also this week we started working on our final report.
