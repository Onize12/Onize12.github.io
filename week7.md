This week was pivotal as it marked the time for our long-awaited presentations, which took place on Wednesday. The preparation leading up to the presentation was intense and demanding, but I’m pleased to say that it went reasonably well. Despite experiencing a bit of anxiety before speaking, I managed to deliver my presentation successfully.
The stress and effort of preparing were significant, but seeing the project come together made it all worthwhile. I also found the other participants' projects quite intriguing; there was a lot of innovative and exciting work being presented, which was both inspiring and enlightening.
In addition to the presentations, we’ve started working on our final report this week. This new phase of the project is crucial, as it involves consolidating our findings and reflecting on the entire process. Although the transition from presentations to report writing adds another layer of complexity to our workload, my team and I are committed to ensuring that the final report is thorough and well-crafted.
Overall, it was a week filled with challenges and accomplishments, and I’m grateful for the experience and the opportunity to collaborate with such dedicated individuals.
