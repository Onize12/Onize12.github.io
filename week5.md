This week turned out to be exceptionally productive, with a variety of engaging activities. We had the pleasure of hosting high school students who visited our lab, providing an excellent opportunity to share our work and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. Presenting to them was both a rewarding and energizing experience.
In addition, I had a personal milestone this weekâ€”I flew a drone by myself for the first time. It was an exhilarating experience, and I felt a sense of accomplishment as I navigated the controls and captured some impressive footage. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my practical skills but also added a new dimension of excitement to my week.
