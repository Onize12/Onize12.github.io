This week was packed with crucial tasks and activities as we focused on several key components of our project. Much of our time was dedicated to perfecting our elevator pitch, preparing for our final presentation, and working on our final report. Each of these elements required substantial effort and attention to detail.

One of the highlights of the week was our visit to the park, where we conducted our elevator pitch practice. Presenting in such a relaxed and informal setting was a refreshing change from the usual environment, and it provided a unique opportunity to refine our delivery and receive constructive feedback in a different context.

The preparation for the final presentation was intense, involving numerous revisions and rehearsals to ensure that everything was polished and professional. Balancing this with the demands of drafting our final report added to the overall busyness of the week. However, the collaborative effort of my team made the process more manageable and productive.

Overall, despite the hectic schedule, the week was both challenging and rewarding. We made significant progress on our project components and gained valuable experience through various activities and practice sessions.[Back](./)
