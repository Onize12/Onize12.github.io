## About My Project

The Satellite Retrieval of Aerosols Using Machine Learning

Problem: Aerosol affect us as humans and our society, a particular type of aerosol with 2.5 micrometers(particulate matter 2.5) has the most impact in our environment. That is why we have decide to focus on that 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Capture PM2.5 data from Aerosol Optical Depth from satellite observations.
  - collect and process data
  - create machine learning model

Expected Outcome: To be able predict future unseen pm2.5 data using machine learning
