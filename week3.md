As we continued through the week, it became increasingly rewarding and engaging. Week three proved to be exceptionally educational and practical, filled with exciting activities and valuable learning opportunities. One of the standout moments was our work with both a helium balloon and a drone. Flying these instruments allowed us to gather precise measurements of PM2.5 concentrations in the air, providing us with hands-on experience in atmospheric data collection.
Additionally, we had the chance to go on a field trip to Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). This visit was incredibly insightful, offering us a glimpse into cutting-edge research and technological advancements. It was a fantastic opportunity to see real-world applications of the concepts weâ€™ve been studying and to interact with professionals in the field.
Overall, week three was an enriching experience, blending practical application with educational enrichment. The combination of fieldwork and the field trip made for a memorable and impactful week.
