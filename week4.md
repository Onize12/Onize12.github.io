This week was productive, as usual, but it lacked a bit of excitement for me. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t get to join the rest of the undergraduates on their visit to NASA, since I'm an international student. While I understand and respect the logistical reasons behind this decision, it was a bit disappointing not to have the opportunity to experience such an exciting and unique event.
Instead, I spent most of the week working alone in the lab. Although it was a bit lonely, I was able to focus deeply on my tasks and make significant progress on my research. The solitude gave me a chance to dive into my work without distractions
