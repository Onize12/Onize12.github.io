First of all this week was fun. I met amazing people and we had amazing discussions. I liked that we were fed breakfast and lunch and the food was good. I also met my mentors Mr Daniel Okon and Ms Xiaowen and my team memebers, Sierra and Zimiego. We had lunch together and we talked about our projects. I liked the team ice breaker we did where we had to build a marshmello tower it was fun and by the way, my team won. I also got to learn the basics of coding this week and also how to use python,Git and Github. Before this week I had no knowledge of coding nothing at all but after each class I felt like a programmer. I like the breaks we have in between lectures and the games we played like Jeopardy and Headbanmds. Overall, this week was exciting and fun, also not as difficult as i thought.
