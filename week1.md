second week was very productuve and interesting. We worked on various data related to our project. I learned how to register and use Giovanni, I learnt more of python and how to dictate complex coding errors. I and my teammates built a cpnnection which made it possible for us to undertand ourselves and work together. I really gained alot this week.
