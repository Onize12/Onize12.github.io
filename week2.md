On this week we were transitioned to our labs with our graduate mentorsa dn team members. My team was merged with another team as our projects were very similar. I like the people i worked it, also we got to fly the weather balloon to measure pm2.5 data in the atmosphere. On wednesday Mr peter was invited to our labs to help us in the continueous learning of python codes.
