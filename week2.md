This week was quite eventful as we transitioned into our labs and began working closely with our graduate mentors and team members. Our team was merged with another team due to the similarity of our projects, which turned out to be a positive development. The new group dynamic was very enjoyable; I found it easy to collaborate with the people I was paired with.
One of the highlights of the week was the opportunity to launch a weather balloon, which allowed us to collect valuable PM2.5 data from the atmosphere. This hands-on experience was not only exciting but also provided us with practical insights into atmospheric measurements.
On Wednesday, we had the privilege of hosting Mr. Peter in our labs. His visit was particularly beneficial as he provided us with further instruction on Python coding. His expertise helped deepen our understanding of Python and its applications, which is crucial for our ongoing projects. Overall, the week was both productive and enriching, with significant progress in our research and coding skills.
